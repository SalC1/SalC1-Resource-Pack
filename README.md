# SalC1 Resource Pack
This is the resource pack I use in mostly all of my videos. Its purpose is to recreate the feeling from beta Minecraft with some older textures and sounds along with other various changes. Some notable differences from Programmer Art are: older textures, the old title screen and logo, and old sounds (includes the old hurt sound). Quality of life features include block roatations being disabled and no pumpkin overlay. If you have any suggestions for changes to this resource pack, let me know on Discord or email me.

IMPORTANT:
You must put "Programmer Art" below my resource pack otherwise it won't function correctly!
